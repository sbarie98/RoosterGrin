<strong>Technologies Used:</strong>
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - JS
    - Bootstrap
    - Font Awesome
I used Bootstrap to help construct the carousel in the last section and Font Awesome 
to construct the star rating icons in the last section as well.

 <strong>Struggles Faced:</strong>
 I'd say I struggled with making all the buttons elements responsive the way I wanted. 
 Along with styling things and tweaking details to make it look exactly the way I want. 
 Although it was mainly a struggle because of the length of time it took me, it was 
 satisfying to get everything laid out the way I wanted. 

<strong>What I Enjoyed:</strong>
I enjoyed a lot about this project, but in particular, I enjoyed working on the carousel 
aspect. If I could do the project again I would want to try and construct it from scratch 
rather than use Bootstrap.
